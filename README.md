# 3D Soul Sys

This project contains the frontend part for the 3D Soul Sys project. It's a 3d web app, built in React with Typescript and ran by Vite, designed to show a 3D representation of the solar system.

## Prerequisites

3D Soul Sys consumes its data, necessary to run the app from a custom designed GraphQL layer over an external API. The repository for this GraphQL layer can be found here: https://github.com/mivd7/soul-sys-server ;
